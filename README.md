### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pedro GÃ³mez! (know as pedrogo by friends ðŸ¤£ ) <br/><br/>
I love web and mobile development with a love-hate story with front-end so if I can choose, will go with backend
  
- ðŸ›  What's in my bag? :
  - Mobile
    - Android with Kotlin and Java
  - Web (Front-end)
    - HTML, CSS and JS
    - React
  - Web (Backend)
    - Spring Framework
    - Vanilla Express.js
    - Nest.js

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - Svelte!
  - Some Rust ðŸ¦€
  
- ðŸ˜Ž Want to learn: 
  - iOS development
  - Flutter
  - Maybe Vue

- âš¡ Fun facts:  
  -  I really like front-end development, but when it comes to self thought designs I'm the less creative person you will ever meet in your life. You can tell just looking at this README ðŸ˜”
  - Javascript is so weird. I love it.
  - I have a blog about everything and nothing at the same time. You can check it out at [pedrogas.me](https://pedrogas.me)
